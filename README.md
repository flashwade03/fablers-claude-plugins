## Plugins

### `vibe-architecture` — Design methodology & skill extraction

Encodes proven design methodologies into skills that Claude loads on demand. No more ad-hoc prompting — just structured workflows that actually work.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **vibe-design** | Turn rough ideas into just-enough design specs. Decisions + Constraints + Milestones, never pseudocode. |
| **design-review** | Score design docs against 6 axes (S~F grade, 0-100 score). Any FAIL caps the grade at C. |
| **sketch-team** | Agent Teams workflow for **concrete multi-domain design**: 1–3 Specialist Designers (data-model / api-surface / protocol / etc., Lead-decided) produce concrete artifacts with inline rejected alternatives, Planner composes with cross-domain coherence checks, 2 Reviewers judge against a concretion-friendly 6-axis rubric, loop until approved. |
| **session-skill-extractor** | Analyze conversations to extract reusable patterns. Routes findings to skills, CLAUDE.md, hookify, or memory. |

```
> /sketch                          # Start a design (single-agent Q&A)
> /sketch-team <task>              # Agent Teams: design + review bundled, auto-iterates
> 설계 리뷰해줘                      # Review a design
> 대화에서 스킬 추출해줘              # Extract skills from session
```

### `damascus` — Forge documents through iterative multi-LLM review

> *Like Damascus steel, documents become stronger through repeated forging.*

Refines documents through an iterative review loop powered by multiple LLMs. Write an implementation plan or technical document, have it reviewed by Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI in parallel, then refine until approved.

```
> /forge <task description>        # Single-reviewer forging
> /forge-team <task description>   # Multi-LLM team review
> /forge-plan <task description>   # Plan-only mode
> /forge-doc <task description>    # Document-only mode
```

### `fablers-agentic-rag` — Ask your documents. Get a cited answer.

Agentic RAG pipeline — query analysis, hybrid retrieval (vector + BM25), CRAG validation, and cited answer synthesis — all orchestrated by Claude agents. Supports PDF, plain text, and Markdown. Pluggable embedding backend: **Gemini** (`gemini-embedding-2-preview`, default) or **OpenAI** (`text-embedding-3-small`).

```
> /ingest <file>                   # Index a document
> /rag-ask <question>              # Query with citations
> /rag-search <query>              # Raw retrieval
```

### `grimoire` — General-purpose reusable skills

Not a single-purpose plugin. A growing collection of Claude Code skills that aren't tied to any one command or workflow — the kind Claude should pull out whenever the situation calls for them, regardless of which other plugin is active. Named `grimoire` because it's a book of reusable patterns; the description you're reading compensates for the metaphor.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **agent-teams** | Run *real* Claude Code agent teams (TeamCreate + SendMessage) for debates, reviews, and implementation — instead of letting a single agent role-play multiple personas. Includes cross-challenge patterns, worked examples, and explicit scope boundaries against `/forge-team`. |

```
> 에이전트 팀 만들어줘               # Spawn a real agent team
> debate with agent teams          # Structured cross-agent debate
```

## Philosophy

1. **Decisions, not implementation** — Design documents record *what* and *why*, never *how*
2. **Progressive disclosure** — Core workflow loads first, details load only when needed
3. **Earn your complexity** — Simple patterns stay simple. Skills are created only when the pattern justifies one
